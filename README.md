# About me
Hi! I'm looking to further my knowledge and integrate within the coding community.

I am currently completing coding courses online and doing independent study. I have already begun exploring HTML5, CSS and Javascript, but I also enjoy learning Python. I am aiming to develop my own portfolio website and break into software development.
