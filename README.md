# About me
Hi! I'm looking to further my knowledge and integrate within the coding community.

I am currently completing coding courses online and doing independent study. I have already begun exploring HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Python, but I also enjoy learning other languages. I am focusing on developing my skills in order to begin my tech career.
