# About me
Hi! I'm looking to further my knowledge and integrate within the coding community.

I am currently completing Harvard's CS50x course. I have already begun exploring HTML5, CSS and Javascript, but I also enjoy learning Python. In the long term, I aim to develop my own portfolio website and break into software development.
